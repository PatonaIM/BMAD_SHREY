## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests

- [ ] All new components render correctly
- [ ] Score threshold logic (60%, 85%)
- [ ] Completeness calculation
- [ ] Score caching (hit/miss/invalidation)

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Resume upload → extraction → wizard → profile
- [ ] Application → score → modal → dashboard
- [ ] Profile edit → score update → cache invalidate

### E2E Tests

- [ ] Score improvement flow (complete profile → score updates)
- [ ] AI interview flow (schedule → complete → boost)

---

## Migration Plan

### For Existing Data

1. **Backfill completeness scores**

   ```typescript
   // Run for all existing profiles
   for (profile of allProfiles) {
     const score = computeCompleteness(profile);
     await updateProfile(profile.id, { cachedCompleteness: score });
   }
   ```

2. **Backfill application scores**

   ```typescript
   // Run for all existing applications
   for (application of allApplications) {
     const score = calculateMatchScore(application);
     await updateApplication(application.id, { matchScore: score });
   }
   ```

3. **Send notification emails**
   - To users with profiles: "See your new profile score!"
   - To users with applications: "View your match scores"

- Monitor performance metrics

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (1 week)

- Gradually increase to 100%
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Collect user feedback

### Rollback Plan

- Feature flags allow instant disable
- Keep old dashboard accessible via `/dashboard/legacy`
