# Profile Editing Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Completeness Percentage Discrepancy

**Problem**: The profile completeness breakdown on the `/profile/edit` page was showing incorrect percentages (0.XX instead of XX%).

**Root Cause**: The `CompletenessDisplay.tsx` component was displaying the raw decimal values (0-1) from `score.breakdown` without converting them to percentages.

**Solution**: Updated `CompletenessDisplay.tsx` to convert decimal values to percentages:

```typescript
const percentage = Math.round(sectionScore * 100);
```

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/profile/CompletenessDisplay.tsx` - Added percentage conversion

### 2. Skills, Experience, Education Not Editable

**Problem**: The profile editor marked skills, experience, and education as "Read-only" and didn't provide any way to edit them.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the ProfileEditor component to make all sections fully editable:

**Skills Section**:

- Editable skill name input
- Proficiency dropdown (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert)
- Remove skill button
- Add new skill button

**Experience Section**:

- Editable job title (position field)
- Company name
- Start date
- End date (auto-marks as current if empty)
- Description textarea
- Remove experience button
- Add new experience button

**Education Section**:

- Editable degree
- Field of study
- Institution name
- Graduation year (endDate)
- Remove education button
- Add new education button

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/profile/ProfileEditor.tsx` - Added full CRUD UI for skills, experience, education
- `src/shared/types/profileEditing.ts` - Extended `AutoSavePayload` to include skills, experience, education
- `src/app/profile/edit/page.tsx` - Updated handleSave to send all editable fields
- `src/services/profile/profileEditingService.ts` - Updated applyEdits to save skills, experience, education changes

### 3. Tags Field Removed

**Problem**: User didn't want tags field cluttering the editor.

**Solution**: Removed the tags input field from ProfileEditor.

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/profile/ProfileEditor.tsx` - Removed tags input section

## Technical Implementation Details

### Type System Updates

Extended the `AutoSavePayload` interface to support structured data editing:

```typescript
export interface AutoSavePayload {
  summary?: string;
  about?: string;
  isPrivate?: boolean;
  tags?: string[];
  // Allow editing structured data
  skills?: ExtractedProfile['skills'];
  experience?: ExtractedProfile['experience'];
  education?: ExtractedProfile['education'];
}
```

### Service Layer Updates

The `ProfileEditingService.applyEdits()` method now:

1. Accepts skills, experience, and education in the request
2. Merges changes into the editable profile
3. Persists all fields back to the extracted_profiles collection
4. Creates version snapshots with complete profile data

### Data Flow

```
User edits skill → ProfileEditor onChange → Local state update → Auto-save debounce →
handleSave() → PUT /api/profile → ProfileEditingService.applyEdits() →
upsertExtractedProfile() → MongoDB extracted_profiles collection
```

### Field Name Mappings

Important field names from the type definitions:

- Experience: `position` (not `title`), `company`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `isCurrent`, `description`
- Education: `institution`, `degree`, `fieldOfStudy`, `startDate`, `endDate`
- Skills: `name`, `category`, `proficiency`, `yearsOfExperience`

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Profile completeness percentages now match between dashboard and edit page
2. ⏳ Skills can be added, edited, and removed
3. ⏳ Experience entries can be added, edited, and removed
4. ⏳ Education entries can be added, edited, and removed
5. ⏳ Auto-save works with structured data changes
6. ⏳ Manual "Save Version" creates snapshots with all changes
7. ⏳ Completeness score recalculates after skills/experience/education changes
8. ⏳ Version restore works with full profile data

## Known Limitations

1. **Category field for skills**: When adding new skills, the category defaults to `'technical'`. This might need a dropdown in the future.
2. **Date validation**: No validation on date format (expects YYYY-MM format)
3. **isCurrent flag**: Automatically set based on whether endDate is empty
4. **UUID types warning**: Pre-existing issue with missing @types/uuid (doesn't affect functionality)

## User Instructions

### Editing Skills

1. Go to `/profile/edit`
2. Scroll to "Skills" section
3. Edit skill names directly in the input fields
4. Change proficiency levels using the dropdowns
5. Click "Remove" to delete a skill
6. Click "+ Add Skill" to add new skills
7. Changes auto-save after 1.5 seconds

### Editing Experience

1. Scroll to "Experience" section
2. Edit job titles, companies, dates, and descriptions
3. Leave end date empty for current positions (automatically marked as current)
4. Click "Remove Experience" to delete an entry
5. Click "+ Add Experience" to add new positions

### Editing Education

1. Scroll to "Education" section
2. Edit degree, field of study, institution, and graduation year
3. Click "Remove Education" to delete an entry
4. Click "+ Add Education" to add new education entries

### Manual Version Snapshots

- Click "Save Version" button at the top to create a named snapshot
- Useful before making major changes
- Can restore from version history panel

## Performance Considerations

- Auto-save debounce: 1.5 seconds (prevents excessive API calls)
- Structured data changes may trigger completeness recalculation (relatively fast)
- Version history limited to recent versions (retention policy applies)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Skill categories dropdown**: Replace hardcoded 'technical' with proper category selection
2. **Date pickers**: Use proper date input components instead of text fields
3. **Inline validation**: Real-time validation for required fields and date formats
4. **Rich text editor**: For experience descriptions and about section
5. **Drag-and-drop reordering**: Allow users to reorder skills, experience, education
6. **Bulk operations**: Select multiple items to delete or modify at once
7. **Import from LinkedIn**: Auto-fill experience and education from LinkedIn profile
