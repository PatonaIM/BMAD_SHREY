# 📋 Epic Overview

## Executive Summary

Transform TeamMatch's application workflow from a linear status-based system into a **dynamic, multi-stage timeline** that supports customizable hiring pipelines with distinct candidate and recruiter perspectives. This epic enables recruiters to orchestrate complex hiring workflows (multiple assignments, live interviews, etc.) while providing candidates with a transparent, action-oriented application journey.

- Multiple assignments per application (up to 3)

- Document uploads and feedback at each stage
- Integrated calendar scheduling and Google Meet links
