# Development Environment Setup Script - Repo Template Enhancement

## User Story

As a **development team member**,
I want **a one-step cross-platform setup script that automatically configures essential development tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux**,
So that **I can quickly bootstrap a new project from the repo template with a fully configured development environment regardless of my operating system**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing repo template folder structure and documentation
- Technology: Cross-platform scripting (Python/PowerShell), development tool configuration, package management
- Follows pattern: Standard repo template initialization patterns
- Touch points: docs/ folder, package.json/requirements.txt, .gitignore, development configuration files

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Cross-Platform Setup Script**: A single executable script that works on Windows (PowerShell), macOS (Bash), and Linux (Bash)
2. **Essential Development Tools Installation**:
   - **Version Control**: Git with team-standard configuration
   - **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with recommended extensions
   - **Containerization**: Docker Desktop with development settings
   - **Testing**: Playwright with browser automation setup
   - **Package Managers**: Node.js/npm and Python/pip
   - **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier (JS), Pylint, Black (Python)
   - **API Development**: Postman for API testing
3. **Claude AI Configuration**: Automatically configures Claude AI coding assistant
4. **CI/CD Setup**: GitHub Actions workflow templates
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Script detects OS and uses appropriate installation methods

### Integration Requirements

6. Existing documentation structure remains unchanged
7. New setup script follows existing repo template patterns
8. Integration with existing folder structure maintains current organization
9. Script creates platform-specific configuration files as needed

### Quality Requirements

10. Setup script is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
11. Script provides clear feedback and error handling for each platform
12. Documentation is updated to include cross-platform setup instructions
13. Script handles missing dependencies gracefully with helpful error messages
14. All tools are configured with team-standard settings

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Script will be placed in root directory and reference existing docs/ structure
- **Cross-Platform Strategy**: 
  - Windows: PowerShell script with Chocolatey/Winget package management
  - macOS: Bash script with Homebrew package management
  - Linux: Bash script with apt/yum/dnf package management
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Standard repo template initialization scripts
- **Key Constraints**: Must work across Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, and Ubuntu 20.04+/CentOS 8+

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Cross-platform setup script created and tested
- [ ] Windows PowerShell script implemented and tested
- [ ] macOS Bash script implemented and tested

- [ ] Script is idempotent and error-handled
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified on all target OS versions
- [ ] Documentation updated with platform-specific setup instructions
- [ ] Script tested on clean environments for all platforms

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Risk Assessment

- **Primary Risk**: Script might conflict with existing system configurations or fail on different OS versions
- **Mitigation**: Script checks for existing configurations, creates backups, and provides clear error messages with resolution steps
- **Rollback**: Script creates backup of existing configurations before making changes and provides restore functionality

### Compatibility Verification

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing repo structure
- [ ] Script preserves existing documentation
- [ ] New files follow existing naming conventions
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (one-time setup)
- [ ] Windows PowerShell execution policy compatibility
- [ ] macOS Homebrew installation compatibility
- [ ] Linux package manager compatibility (apt/yum/dnf)

## Recommended Development Tools (Minimum Set)

### Core Development Tools
- **Git**: Version control with team-standard configuration
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDE with recommended extensions
- **Docker Desktop**: Containerization platform
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing framework

### Package Managers
- **Node.js + npm**: JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Python + pip**: Python runtime and package manager

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint + Prettier**: JavaScript linting and formatting
- **Pylint + Black**: Python linting and formatting

### Additional Tools
- **Postman**: API development and testing
- **Claude AI**: AI coding assistant configuration
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflow templates

## Implementation Tasks
