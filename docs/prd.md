# TeamMatch AI-Powered Job Application System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Transform hiring processes:** Replace manual resume screening with AI-enhanced semantic matching achieving 85% accuracy in candidate-job fit assessment (vs current 40% manual accuracy)
- **Candidate success metrics:** Achieve 2x higher interview rates (target: 40% interview rate vs industry average 20%) for candidates completing full platform journey including AI interviews
- **Recruiter efficiency gains:** Reduce average screening time from 23 hours to 14 hours per hire while improving quality scores by 25% through AI pre-filtering and structured feedback
- **Platform differentiation:** Launch first-to-market combination of semantic AI matching (OpenAI embeddings) with interactive AI interviews (Realtime API + D-ID avatars) creating 10-15 point score improvement opportunity
- **Transparency and feedback:** Deliver 90% candidate satisfaction with feedback quality and 95% application status transparency (measured via NPS surveys and platform analytics)
- **Revenue and scale targets:** Generate $500K ARR within 12 months through tiered SaaS model ($99/month recruiters, $19/month premium candidates) supporting 10,000 MAU job seekers and 100 active enterprise clients
- **Technical foundation:** Build scalable architecture supporting 50,000+ concurrent users, <3 second page loads, 99.9% uptime, and seamless integration with existing ATS systems (Phase 2)

### Background Context

**Market Problem Analysis:**
The hiring landscape suffers from systemic inefficiencies affecting both sides of the talent marketplace. Current ATS systems filter out 75% of qualified candidates through primitive keyword matching, while recruiters spend an average of 23 hours per hire on initial screening activities. This creates a documented $240B annual inefficiency in the US hiring market, with 67% of recruiters reporting difficulty finding qualified candidates and 84% of job seekers expressing frustration with "black box" application processes.

**Specific Pain Points:**

- **Resume Parsing Limitations:** Current systems miss 40-60% of relevant skills due to formatting variations and synonym recognition failures
- **Screening Bottlenecks:** Phone screens reveal basic mismatches in 30% of cases that could be caught earlier
- **Feedback Gaps:** 89% of candidates receive no meaningful feedback, reducing platform loyalty and repeat usage
- **Bias Introduction:** Manual screening introduces unconscious bias in 45% of initial reviews (McKinsey 2024 study)

**Solution Architecture:**
TeamMatch addresses these challenges through a comprehensive AI-first platform combining:

- **Semantic Understanding:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-large models process full resume context (not just keywords) achieving 85% accuracy in skill extraction vs 40% for traditional parsing
- **Interactive Assessment:** 15-20 minute AI interviews using OpenAI Realtime API provide standardized soft skill evaluation missing from resume-only assessment
- **Professional Presentation:** D-ID avatar technology creates engaging, bias-free interview experiences maintaining professional standards
- **Transparent Scoring:** Multi-factor scoring algorithm (40% semantic match, 35% skills alignment, 15% experience level, 10% additional factors) with detailed explanations

**Technical Foundation Validation:**
Our October 27, 2025 architecture session confirmed:

- **Scalability:** MongoDB Atlas Vector Search supports 100M+ embeddings with <100ms query times
- **Development Efficiency:** Next.js full-stack approach reduces complexity and deployment overhead
- **Cost Structure:** OpenAI API costs projected at $0.15-0.30 per candidate assessment, sustainable for freemium model
- **Integration Path:** NextAuth.js + Material-UI provides rapid MVP development with enterprise-ready foundation
