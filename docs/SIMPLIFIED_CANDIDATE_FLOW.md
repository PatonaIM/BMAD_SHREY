# Simplified Candidate Flow - Implementation Guide

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Epics Updated - Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes needed to implement the simplified 11-step candidate flow, replacing the complex multi-path journey with a streamlined experience focused on: **Discover → Apply → Upload Resume → Create Profile → Score → Dashboard → Improve**.

## The 11-Step Flow

1. **Candidate sees open jobs** (Homepage with SEO optimization)
2. **Logs in to portal to apply** (Multi-provider auth)
3. **Uploads the resume** (PDF/DOC upload)
4. **We extract the resume** (AI-powered extraction)
5. **We create a profile** (Guided wizard with extracted data)
6. **We generate a score** (Candidate-job match scoring)
7. **We take the candidate to dashboard** (Centralized hub)
8. **Candidate can see applications, job-wise score, profile completeness, other open jobs, job suggestions** (Dashboard widgets)
9. **Candidate can complete profile to improve score** (Profile editing with real-time completeness)
10. **Candidate can give AI interview to boost their profile** (Score boosting mechanism)
11. **Candidate can see application statuses** (Timeline tracking)

## API Changes Needed

### New Endpoints

```typescript
// Batch score calculation for job lists
POST /api/jobs/batch-score
Request: { jobIds: string[], userId: string }
Response: { scores: Record<string, number> }

// Get profile recommendations
GET /api/profile/recommendations
Response: { recommendations: string[], priorityActions: string[] }

// Track interview eligibility
GET /api/applications/interview-eligible
Response: { eligibleApplications: Application[], estimatedBoost: number }
```

### Modified Endpoints

// Add score calculation to job queries
GET /api/jobs?includeScores=true&userId={userId}

// Include completeness in profile response
GET /api/profile?computeCompleteness=true

// Add post-application guidance
POST /api/applications (returns guidance data in response)
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- [ ] ProfileCompletenessCard component
- [ ] MatchScoreBadge (all score ranges)
- [ ] PostApplicationModal (all threshold scenarios)
- [ ] Score threshold logic (60%, 85% breakpoints)
- [ ] Caching service (hit/miss/invalidation)

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Full resume → profile wizard flow
- [ ] Application submission → score → modal → dashboard
- [ ] Profile edit → score recalculation → cache invalidation
- [ ] AI interview completion → score boost → dashboard update

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

- [ ] New user: Browse → Register → Upload Resume → Create Profile → Apply
- [ ] Apply → See score → Complete Profile → Score improves
- [ ] Apply → Low score → AI Interview → Score boost
- [ ] Dashboard: View completeness → Click recommendation → Edit profile

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

**Users with profiles but no completeness data:**

- Run one-time migration to calculate completeness scores
- Backfill missing recommendations
- Send email: "See how to improve your profile"

**Users with applications but no scores:**

- Batch calculate scores for all existing applications
- Update application records with scores
- Add "New: See your match scores!" dashboard banner

### Database Migrations

```typescript
// Add fields to Application schema
{
  matchScore: number | undefined,  // Add if missing
  scoreBreakdown: object | undefined,  // Add if missing
  aiInterviewEligible: boolean  // Calculate based on score
}

// Add fields to Profile schema
{
  cachedCompleteness: CompletenessScore | undefined,
  lastScoreUpdate: Date | undefined
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks

**Risk:** Score calculation on every job list load is slow.  
**Mitigation:**

- Implement caching layer (Redis or in-memory for MVP)
- Batch calculate scores for job lists
- Cache TTL: 1 hour (invalidate on profile change)
- Show cached scores immediately, recalculate in background

**Risk:** Dashboard loads too much data.  
**Mitigation:**

- Paginate applications list
- Lazy load widgets (load above-the-fold first)
- Use React Suspense for async components
- Add loading skeletons

### UX Risks

**Risk:** Too many modals/interruptions annoy users.  
**Mitigation:**

- Auto-dismiss modals after 10 seconds
- "Don't show again" option for guidance modals
- Only show post-application modal once per session
- Use toasts for non-critical updates

**Risk:** Users don't understand completeness scores.  
**Mitigation:**

- Show examples of "good" vs "excellent" profiles
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Use progress bars and visual indicators
- Link directly to sections needing improvement

## Next Steps

1. **Review this document** with product and engineering teams
2. **Prioritize stories** within each phase based on dependencies
3. **Create implementation tickets** in Jira/Linear/GitHub Issues
4. **Assign to developers** based on frontend/backend/AI expertise
5. **Set up feature flags** for gradual rollout
6. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** (Weeks 1-2)
